"""Phase 4 - Define Targets: split merged_long.csv into the two prediction tasks.

Reads merged/merged_long.csv (one row per prompt+model, with engineered
prompt features) and writes:

  merged/model_a_token_predictor.csv
      X: prompt features + model name
      y: input_tokens, output_tokens          (regression)

  merged/model_b_quality_predictor.csv
      X: prompt features + model name
      y: quality  (Bad / Average / Good / Excellent)   (classification)

Rows with row_ok == False (missing/invalid token counts, already filtered
mostly by clean_datasets.py, kept here as a belt-and-suspenders check) are
dropped from both. Model name is left as a raw categorical column ("model")
-- one-hot/ordinal encoding is a modeling-step concern, not a target-definition
concern, so it's deliberately not encoded here.

EXCLUDED_MODELS are dropped entirely: llama3 and opencode/big-pickle logged
input_tokens values wildly inconsistent with prompt length (e.g. char_count
156 -> input_tokens 6266 for big-pickle; llama3 averaged ~8x the token/char
ratio of every other model). That points to a collection bug in those two
sources rather than real signal, so they're excluded until re-collected.

Does not modify merged_long.csv.
